### `Introduction`

Software engineering is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method.

Why Software engineering?

1. As Software development is expensive so proper measures are required so that the resources are used efficiently and effectively.

2. Cost and time considerations are another factor, which arises the need for Software Engineering.

3. Reliability factors.

Main Principal: The Vision must be clear.
